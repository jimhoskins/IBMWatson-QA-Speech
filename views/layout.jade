                h2 CogAbility Technology Demo
                p CogAbility is a next-generation cognitive computing platform powered by IBM Watson - first made famous by beating Jeopardy champions in 2011.
                  |  The CogAbility platform can be customized to meet a wide range of needs in whole new ways and revolutionize the way people engage with computing systems. 
                p In this technology demonstration, CogAbility accepts simple health questions posed in natural language by the user and then provides the answer along with a confidence level assigned to that answer.
                  | CogAbilityâ€™s Text-To-Speech function is used to synthesize natural sounding speech from the answer text.
                p Note: There has been minimal Watson training effort applied so the health answers provided are just from demonstration purposes and are not reliable. Audio not available on some devices.

            h3 Disclaimer
            p CogAbility powered by Watson is incredibly powerful. This simple technology demonstration is using a 
              | sample public healthcare
              |  data set, which is only trained to answer 
              | specific kinds of questions
              | . Check this out to see what a properly trained CogAbility instance can do for you. This demo requires HTML5 audio for playing sounds. Parts of this demo may
              | not work if your browser does not support these features.
